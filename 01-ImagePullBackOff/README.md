# ImagePullBackoff

When a kubelet starts creating containers for a Pod using a container runtime, it might be possible the container is in Waiting state because of ImagePullBackOff.

The status ImagePullBackOff means that a container could not start because Kubernetes could not pull a container image for reasons such as 

- Invalid image name or tags 
- Pulling from a private registry without imagePullSecret.
- Check Network Connectivity: Ensure that the node has network access to the container registry. You can try pulling the image manually using docker pull <image-name> to verify connectivity

The BackOff part indicates that Kubernetes will keep trying to pull the image, with an increasing back-off delay.

Kubernetes raises the delay between each attempt until it reaches a compiled-in limit, which is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
