Learn how to troubleshoot the most common Kubernetes Issues

## Day-01

### ImagePullBackOff

Video Link - https://youtu.be/vGab4v3RWEw

When a kubelet starts creating containers for a Pod using a container runtime, it might be possible the container is in Waiting state because of ImagePullBackOff.

The status ImagePullBackOff means that a container could not start because Kubernetes could not pull a container image for reasons such as 

- Invalid image name or 
- Pulling from a private registry without imagePullSecret. 

The BackOff part indicates that Kubernetes will keep trying to pull the image, with an increasing back-off delay.

Kubernetes raises the delay between each attempt until it reaches a compiled-in limit, which is 300 seconds (5 minutes).


## Day-02

### CrashLoopBackOff

When you see "CrashLoopBackOff," it means that kubelet is trying to run the container, but it keeps failing and crashing. After crashing, Kubernetes tries to restart the container automatically, but if the container keeps failing repeatedly, you end up in a loop of crashes and restarts, thus the term "CrashLoopBackOff." 

This situation indicates that something is wrong with the application or the configuration that needs to be fixed.

## Day-03

### Pods not schedulable

In Kubernetes, the scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes in the cluster based on various criteria. Sometimes, you might encounter situations where pods are not being scheduled as expected. This can happen due to factors such as node constraints, pod requirements, or cluster configurations.

1. Node Selector
2. Node Affinity
3. Taints
4. Tolerations

## Day-04 

## Forbiden pod error
    1 Check Error Message:
Read the error message to understand what action was denied and for which resource.

   2 Verify Context and User:
Ensure you're using the correct kubectl context and user.(kubectl config current-context)

     3 Check User Permissions:
Verify what actions the user can perform.
kubectl auth can-i --list

     4 Inspect RBAC Roles and Bindings:
List and describe relevant roles and bindings

    5 Adjust RBAC Settings:
Grant necessary permissions by creating or modifying roles and bindings.

## Day-05
OOMKILLLED ERROR ( exit code 137)

Out of Memory (OOM) killed errors in Kubernetes occur when a container exceeds its memory limits, causing the system to terminate the process to free up memory. Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve OOMKilled errors in Kubernetes:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

     1 Identify the OOMKilled Pod:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

2 Check Resource Limits:
Ensure the pod has appropriate memory requests and limits set.
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml | grep -A 10 resources

3 Increase Memory Limits:
Edit the deployment or pod to increase the memory limit.
kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace>

4 Update the resources section:
yaml
Copy code
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"

    6  RELOADER
Tools like Reloader help to automatically restart pods when a ConfigMap or Secret is updated.
Steps to Implement Reloader:
Deploy Reloader:
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts
helm install reloader stakater/reloader
Annotate deployments to watch ConfigMaps or Secrets:
annotations:
  reloader.stakater.com/match: "true"
  
7   CONFIG OUT OF DATE
ConfigMap or Secret used by the pods has been updated, but pods are not reloaded.
Solution:
Trigger a rolling restart to apply new configuration:
kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
Use a reloader (like Reloader or Kustomize) to automatically restart pods on config updates.

8 ENABLE SERVICE LINK 

The enableServiceLinks field determines whether environment variables are injected into the container for linked services. Problems can occur with unnecessary environment variables.
Solution:
Disable enableServiceLinks in the pod spec if itâ€™s not required:
spec:
  enableServiceLinks: false
The enableServiceLinks field in a Kubernetes Pod specification determines whether environment variables are automatically injected into the container for all services in the namespace. These environment variables are derived from service properties, such as their Cluster IP and port.
   How it Works
When enableServiceLinks is set to true (default behavior), Kubernetes will:

Inject environment variables for all available services in the namespace into the container.
Follow a naming convention like:
<SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_HOST for the service's Cluster IP.
<SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_PORT for the service's port.

9 Create Container Error
Issues with the container image (e.g., not found, unauthorized, corrupt).
Misconfigured container specifications (e.g., invalid commands or environment variables).
Solution:
Check pod events for details:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

Verify the container image is accessible and correct:
docker pull <image-name>
Fix errors in container specifications in the deployment YAML.
